# BassSynth

This work-in-progress is my first attempt at building a bass synth plugin inspired by the EHX Bass Micro Synth. There are two branches here. The "master" branch is the testing branch that loads a bass loop. The "liveInput" branch takes input from the default audio input device. Note that this is "inspired by" the EHX pedal. It isn't intended to be a clone or even sound like the EHX. Ultimately, when this is done, I'll have a bass synth processor that is unique and useful.
